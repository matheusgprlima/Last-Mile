Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has exerted a profound impact on global public
health, claiming millions of lives (1). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART or ART)
has significantly altered the natural course of HIV infection, prolonging survival and
improving quality of life for those affected (1, 2). However, ART is not curative: it cannot
eliminate latent viral reservoirs (3–5), necessitates lifelong
adherence, and is associated with cumulative drug toxicity and
the emergence of resistant viral strains (2, 6).
Traditional immune-based strategies—such as the use of
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to target circulating virus
(7–9) or immunostimulatory agents to enhance host immune
responses (10, 11)—have shown promise but remain limited in
their ability to eliminate latent HIV. Similarly, allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is
constrained by high procedural risk and donor scarcity (6, 12).
The discovery of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) as a major
HIV co-receptor represents a breakthrough in overcoming these
limitations. HIV entry into CD4+ T cells and other host cells
requires not only CD4 receptor binding but also co-receptors
such as CCR5 or CXCR4 (3, 13). Case studies of the "Berlin" and
"London" patients—who achieved viral remission following
transplantation from CCR5-D32 homozygous donors—have
provided compelling evidence that genetic disruption of CCR5
can confer natural resistance to R5-tropic HIV strains (6, 12).
These findings have catalyzed the rapid development of gene
editing technologies targeting CCR5, including CRISPR/Cas9, for
potential curative therapy (9, 13–15).
This paper seeks to address four key questions:
1. Synergistic Multi-target Editing: How can simultaneous
editing of CCR5, CXCR4, and HIV LTR collectively
establish a comprehensive viral blockade to counteract
tropism switching and latent reactivation?
2. Gene-Immune Synergy: How can gene editing augment the
anti-HIV capacity and persistence of immune cells?
Conversely, how can immunotherapy complement gene
editing to eradicate latent reservoirs more effectively?
3. Personalized Approaches for Clinical Heterogeneity: Given
the high variability in viral subtypes, host immunity, and
genetic background among HIV-infected individuals, how
can we design broadly applicable yet individually adaptable
treatment regimens?
4. Balancing Safety and Accessibility: How can we ensure
long-term safety while enhancing global accessibility
through technological optimization and innovative
payment models?
Figure 1 outlines the integrated framework for HIV treatment,
which systematically combines multi-target gene editing with
synergistic immunotherapy, not only intervening at key stages of
HIV infection but also addressing implementation challenges in
clinical applications.
2 Current advances in integrating gene editing with immunotherapy for HIV
For R5-tropic HIV-1 strains—which dominate during the early
and chronic phases of infection—C-C chemokine receptor 5
(CCR5) is an essential co-receptor for viral entry into CD4+ T
cells and macrophages (3, 13). Its expression directly determines the
susceptibility of these target cells to HIV. Individuals with naturally
occurring CCR5 deletions, such as the homozygous CCR5-D32 mutation, exhibit high resistance to HIV-1 infection, providing a
theoretical rationale for CCR5-targeted gene editing as a therapeutic
strategy (6, 12).
In recent years, molecular tools including zinc finger nucleases
(ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs),
and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR)/Cas system have enabled precise targeting and editing of
the CCR5 gene (14, 16, 17). Each technology offers unique features
and therapeutic potential in the context of HIV treatment (see
Table 1). Notably, CCR5 editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has progressed
to early-phase clinical trials, including NCT03164135, which
assessed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CCR5 editing in hematopoietic
stem cells for patients with both HIV and acute lymphoblastic
leukemia—demonstrating feasibility and safety (18).
Chronic viral infections such as HIV, HBV, and HCV share the
common hallmark of progressive T cell exhaustion, which is closely
linked to sustained expression of immune checkpoint molecules like
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-L1, and cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) (19). Evidence suggests
that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may restore the function of HIV-specific
CD8+ T cells, improving their ability to clear infected cells and
potentially reactivating latent reservoirs (20, 21). Additionally, anti-
PD-1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown efficacy
in targeting SIV-infected CD4+ T cells in germinal centers of non-
human primate models (19), raising interest in the use of immune
checkpoint inhibitors in HIV treatment.`;
