Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a major global public
health challenge. Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART or ART)
can effectively control viral replication, it fails to eradicate latent viral reservoirs
and poses limitations such as lifelong medication and cumulative drug toxicity.
This study focuses on the pivotal role of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene
editing in HIV immunotherapy, particularly highlighting the natural resistance to
R5-tropic HIV strains observed in the “Berlin” and “London” patients carrying the
homozygous CCR5-D32mutation. We further explore the synergistic potential of
multiplex gene editing strategies—including CCR5, CXCR4, and HIV LTR loci—
and the combinatorial mechanisms between gene editing technologies and
immunotherapy. A personalized treatment framework is proposed to address
the clinical heterogeneity among people living with HIV. In addition, we assess
the balance between long-term safety and global accessibility of gene-editing
approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9, emphasizing strategies to enhance
therapeutic efficacy while reducing cost and off-target effects. Our findings
suggest that the integration of CCR5-targeted gene editing with immune-
based interventions holds great promise for overcoming current therapeutic
limitations and achieving functional HIV cure. However, key challenges—such as
immune rejection, viral tropism switching, and economic feasibility—must be
resolved. This integrative approach provides a robust theoretical and technical
foundation for the next generation of HIV treatment paradigms.`;
